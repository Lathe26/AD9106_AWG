# Tools

This folder contains tools related to the AD9106 AWG device.

All Python-based tools are run against pylint version 3.0.3 to verify portions of the code.  No warnings are logged pylint when it is run against awg_ad9106.py.  Only a few warnings are disable in specific code locations.  Any merge requests that include Python code must pass pylint without logging any warnings.

## awg_ad9106.py

**Summary:** Command-line tool to issue commands to a AWG AD9106 device and load arbitrary waveforms into its SRAM.

**Details**

Commands can be issued from the command line and/or from text files that contains a series of commands.  The combined list of commands set to the device can be also saved to a text file for later playback.  The parent folder's `README.md` documents the known commands.

Arbitrary waveforms can be input from the same text files, from CSV files, and/or from audio WAV files.  When data from from a CSV file, one column of data can be loaded or a weighted average from multiple columns.  The same is true for WAV files, with the only difference being that option that specific 'column numbers' refer to audio channel numbers.  Column 0 refers to the mono channel or left channel.  Column 1 refers to the right channel.  Columns numbers 2 or higher refer to their respective audio channel numbers.  WAV files with 8-bit, 16-bit, and higher are supported.

**Installation Requirements**

- python 3.x (developed and tested against 3.9.5)
- pyserial (developed and tested against 3.5)

**Further Documentation**

Run `python awg_ad9106.py --help` (or inspect the source code).

**Example Input Files**

- `Sample Formulas.csv` contains multiple waveforms of sines, parabolas, square waves, etc.  Use `--column-selected` to chose a single waveform
- `Fourier Frequencies.wav` contains the first 16 sine waves and 16 cosine waves used in Fourier Series.  These can be merged together if the Fourier Series co-effiecients are passed in via `--column-weights`.  The file is organized so that sin(x) and cos(x) are channels 0 and 1, sin(2x) and cos(2x) are channels 2 and 3, sin(3x) and cos(3x) are channels 4 and 5, and etc.  The file is a 32-channel, 16-bit, WAV file.

**Example Usages**

A slowing down square wave

`python awg_ad9106.py -d -p COM39 --csv "Sample Formulas.csv" --column-selected 10`

Sum of 16 sine waves shows as 16 strong peaks on a spectrum analyzer or an oscilloscope with FFT abilities

`python awg_ad9106.py -d -p COM39 --csv "Sample Formulas.csv" --column-selected 5`
`
A chirp waveform

`python awg_ad9106.py -d -p COM39 --csv "Sample Formulas.csv" --column-selected 6`

Fourier Series approximation of a Sawtooth Down wave, using the 1st 16 sin co-efficients as the column weights, which are 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... 1/n.  Co-efficients for cos terms are 0.0

Fourier Series approximation of a Square wave, using the 1st 16 sin co-efficients as the column weights, which are 1, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/5, 0, 1/7, ... 1/(2n+1).  Co-efficients for cos terms are 0.0

## Future Tool Ideas

These are potential tools that folks can take on.

- Tool that parses a saved list of commands and converts the arbitrary data back to CSV file format.  Feature details:
    - High-pri: Save data normalized to -1.0 to 1.0 range.
    - High-pri: Handle gaps in the data, such as when a Z command does not contain 64 values or when block numbers are skipped or missing (i.e., the 2 digits that follow the 'Z' character).
    - Medium-pri: If SRAM0 thru SRAM2 commands are also detected, save the data that follows each SRAM command in columns 0, 1, and/or 2.
    - Medium-pri: Option to save as SRAM values of 0 to 511 range.
    - Low-pri: Option to convert to WAV file format.
