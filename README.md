# AD9106 Arbitrary Waveform Generator


# Overview 

This document discusses a particular Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) that is based on the AD9106 chip by Analog Devices.  While the chip itself has documentation located at [https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad9106.html](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad9106.html), the documentation for the AWG device is scant.

![Image of AD9106 AWG device](./docs/AD9106_AWG.jpg)

The device does not appear to have a canonical name.  Below are example names it is sold under on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us) and/or [eBay](https://www.ebay.com):
- AD9106 4-Channel Arbitrary Waveform Generator 12Bit 180MSPS + STM32 Touch LCD
- AD9106 4-channel DAC low-power, DDS 12-bit, 180 MSPS digital-to-analog converter and waveform generator
- AD9106 4CH Arbitrary Waveform Generator 12Bit 180MSPS + Master Control Board sup
- AD9106 4CH Arbitrary Waveform Generator 12Bit 180MSPS + STM32 Control Board TPS
- AD9106 Four-channel12-bit 180MSPS digital-to-analog converter waveform generator
- AD9106 Four-channel DAC Low-power, DDS 12-bit /180 MSPS Digital-to-analog Converter and Waveform Generator

Topics covered include how to manually operate the AWG device via its touch screen, its output, its USB communication, and other details.

The maximum frequencies for the AWG are:
- 30MHz for sine 
- ~11KHz for sawtooth up/down
- ~5.5KHz for triangle
- Maximum frequency for arbitrary waveforms varies according to the length of the data in SRAM, but when the entire 4K SRAM is used then the frequency is 43.94 KHz

Note that the AWG device exposes many, but not all possible features, of the AD9106 chip.

As of firmware 1.1, some notable features not exposed are:
- adjustable DC voltage offsets
- ability to add CH3 to CH1's output and CH4 to CH2's output
- creation of arbitrary waveforms via the device's touch screen, though there are 3 pre-stored waveforms available via the touch screen and arbitrary data can be uploaded over USB


# Manual Operation


## Switches and Connectors

There is a tiny On/Off switch on the top right edge of the top board.

The AWG has 5 SMA connectors.

Four of the SMA connectors labeled as OUT1 through OUT4 are outputs connectors for the generated signals.  These connectors expect to be 50 Ohm terminated.  The complete voltage range is 1.6 Vpp centered at 0V (i.e., -0.8V to 0.8V) though this range is reduced at high frequencies.  One mode, the noise ("Nosie"), is limited to a range of 0V to 0.1V.

The 5th SMA connector is the CLK_IN connector.  Despite its name, by default it is an *output* of the 180 MHz crystal oscillator on the bottom board with a voltage range of 0.56V to 1.30V while *unterminated*.  If output is 50 Ohm terminated, the AWG stops operating.  The CLK_IN becomes an *input* if pin 1 of the 180 MHz crystal oscillator on the bottom board is grounded.  When inputting an external clock, the bottom board has 50 Ohm termination.  Pin 1 is the upper-right of the of the oscillator when looking down at the AWG normally.

The AWG also has a USB-C connector for power and communication.


## User Interface

The main user interface has 5 touch screen buttons at the bottom edge of the screen.  These are used to change values, switch between controlling each of the 4 channels, and change between the 7 different output modes per each channel.  The rest of the screen displays values and is not used for touch input.

The 5 buttons are:
- `Left` & `Right` are used for moving the cursor around the screen.
- `Add` & `Dec` increase or decrease the value were the cursor is located.
- `OK` is used to activate the output mode displayed on the screen after switching to a new mode.  This button is not needed when changing values for the active output mode.


### Summary of Modes and Settings
There are 7 output modes that are individually settable per channel.  In summary, they are:

Mode Name   | Summary
------------|--------------
Signal      | Sine wave
Sawtooth    | Sawtooth up, sawtooth down, or triangle wave
Nosie       | Noise signal (on-screen text is misspelled)
Random      | Arbitrary waveform from SRAM, *not random*
ChispSAW    | Partial or full single cycle of a sawtooth or triangle wave in a Mod CYC period
ChispDDS    | CYC number of sine waves in a Mod CYC period
RAM Modu    | Sine wave that is AM modulated by SRAM data

Each output mode is altered by various on-screen settings.  The table below lists all settings, what register or field they relate to on the AD9106 chip, whether the setting is global across all outputs or a per output setting, and general descriptions.

Setting   | Register       | Range           | Effect     | Comment
----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|--------
Frequency | DDSTW          | 0 Hz - 30 MHz   | global     | Sine wave frequency, output is limited to 10.73 Hz increments
Phase     | DDSx_PHASE     | 0 - 360         | per output | Phase of the sine wave in degrees
Power     | DACx_DIG_GAIN  | 0 - 16383       | per output | Amplitude of the wave's voltage (not power), values are linear, max is +/- 0.8 V except for Noise mode
S         | SAW_TYPEx      | UP, DW, TR, NOP | per output | Whether to perform sawtooth up, sawtooth down, triangle, or no waveform
SAWC      | SAW_STEPx      | 6 bits          | per output | Period of sawtooth or triangle wave.  Only 64 values (see below)
SRAM      | SRAM           | 0 - 2           | global     | Which of 3 stored waveforms to fill SRAM with (see below)
SA        | START_ADDRx    | 0000 - ffff     | per output | Starting address to use for SRAM data, value is 0-based
SP        | STOP_ADDRx     | 0000 - ffff     | per output | Ending address to use for SRAM data, value is 0-based
Mod CYC   | PATTERN_PERIOD | 0000 - ffff     | global     | Length of Pattern Period in 180 MHz clock ticks
STD       | START_DELAYx   | 0000 - ffff     | per output | Number of 180 MHz clock ticks to delay starting the waveform in a Pattern Period
CYC       | DDS_CYCx       | 0000 - ffff     | per output | Number of sine, sawtooth, triangle wave cycles to perform during a Pattern Period

Extended comments:
- Frequency is rounded *down* to the nearest multiple of 10.73 Hz.  Thus, if the on-screen setting is 21 Hz then the output is actually 10.73 Hz while 22 Hz on-screen generates 21.46 Hz output.
- SAWC is displayed as 6 bits instead of as a decimal value of 0-63.  For sawtooth up and down, the waveform's period is SAWC \* 91.0 usec, or more precisely is SAWC \* 16384 / (180 MHz).  The exception is that SAWC = 0 acts as the value 64, thus the period is 5.825 msec.  For triangle, the period is 2x as long.
- SRAM waveforms are loaded from the device's internal FLASH.  There are 3 waveforms to choose from.  They are prepopulated from the factory but are can be overwritten by sending arbitrary waveform data to the device over USB.
- From the factory, the SRAM waveforms are sum of 1, 2, or 3 sine waves, respectively.  Variable x ranges from 0 to 360 degrees but in 4096 increments to produce 1 full cycle that fills the AD9106's SRAM.
    - SRAM 0 is the formula $`sin(x)`$
    - SRAM 1 is the formula $`sin(x) + sin(2x)`$
    - SRAM 2 is the formula $`sin(x) + sin(2x) + sin(3x)`$
- The SA and SP values are 16-bit values but only the top 12-bits are used.  Thus, SA and SP are the start and stop sample numbers multiplied by 16 (aka, left shifted by 4 bits).  - To playback the entire SRAM contents without any added pauses, set SA to 0000, SP to FFFF, and Mod CYC to 0x1000.
- Mod CYC defines the pattern period, which is (Mod CYC) / (180 MHz).  For example, if Mod CYC is 0x1000, then the period is 22.7555 usec or 43.945 KHz.
- Odd behavior has been observed when some setting are set to 0, when the STD (start delay) is longer than the Pattern Period, and other unusual settings.
- Most of the settings that affect each mode are displayed on their respective screens.  However, a handful of settings from one mode can affect another mode.  For example, Phase can be set in one mode and affect ChispDDS mode.

Comparison graphs of the Frequency setting to output frequency as a percentage of the input Frequency setting.  For example, if Frequency setting is set to 21 Hz, then the actual output frequency is 10.73 Hz which is 51.1% of the input Frequency setting.  The first graph shows a few select values from actual measurements.  Phase setting was 0.  Power setting was 16383.  The second graph is a plot of all Frequency settings using a computed formula, not measurements.

## Signal Noise

Spectrum analysis of sine wave output on CH1, using Signal Mode with Power setting of 16383, for 5, 10, 20, and 30 MHz frequencies.  60 dB attenuation used to avoid clipping by the spectrum analyzer.  Notes:

- Observer the -35 dBm of 180 MHz noise and the 2 neighboring harmonics.
- The MHz readings for the peaks are only accurate to +/- a few 100 kHz due to horizontal screen resolution.
- The below were measured *without* the use of a Faraday cage.  Thus some external signals may have leaked into the circuit, such a 94.9 FM radio station.

The various channels have a different amount of inherent noise.  The following inherent noise measurements from one AWG device when no waveform was output, specifically a sine wave of 0 Hz and Power setting of 0.  No attenuators were used.

- CH1: 14.0 mVpp (range -1.9 to 13.0 mV).  It has frequency components primarily at 180 MHz.
- CH2: 10.2 mVpp (range -4.3 to  5.9 mV).  It has frequency components primarily at 14.82 MHz, 180 MHz, 9.88 MHz, as well as a large number of odd harmonics of 365 KHz.
- CH3:  5.0 mVpp (range -8.0 to -3.0 mV).  It has frequency components primarily at 180 MHz.
- CH4:  4.8 mVpp (range -1.0 to  3.8 mV).  It has frequency components primarily at 180 MHz.

AC coupled inherent noise, displayed with 20 mV DC offsets, on a wide time base:

![Inherent noise, wide time base](docs/Signal_Noise_AC_Coupled_Wide.png)

Spectrum analysis of the above inherent noise was performed for CH1 thru CH4.  A lower noise floor was possible here when compared to the prior sine wave output spectrum analysis (i.e., the dBm scale on the right side shifted to lower values).

# USB communication

## Drivers

In theory, the AN9106 AWG operates as USB serial device.  It shows up as COM port or as a tty, depending on the operating system.

On Windows 10, the built-in drivers should automatically load.  However, some uses have reported issues.  In this case, download STMicroelectronics Virtual COM Port driver designed for Windows 8 and use Windows Device Manager to force these drivers to be used instead.

## Protocol

Documentation for the protocol has been mostly determined by translating the documentation from Chinese to English.  Both versions of the documentation are available in the `manuals` directory of the repository.

Broad properties are:

- It is an ASCII protocol that requires a line-ending of CR+LF (i.e., two bytes of 0D 0A, alternatively as CTRL+M followed by CTRL+J)
- Commands are case-sensitive
- There is no remote echo (i.e., device does not echo back what was typed)
- Most commands do not generate a response of any kind.  The only exceptions are the `XXX` and `OVER` commands.
- Commands that set values update the device's screen immediately.

The following commands are documented:

- `XXX`
    - Description: retrieve all the device's current Settings.  The response is described later but to summarize, it is a list of the most of commands with their values, then a series of numbers for a few specific commands, and ends with the word `OVER`.
    - Example: `XXX`
- `CHANNEL` + value
    - Description: sets the currently displayed channel.
    - Example: `CHANNEL4` sets CH4 to be displayed
- `MOD` + channel + value
    - Description: sets a channel's mode (i.e., to Signal, Sawtooth, ChispDDS, etc.).  Valid values range from 1 - 7, corresponding to the modes Signal thru RAM Modu, respectively.
    - Example: `MOD24` sets CH2 to mode 4
- `FREQ` + value
    - Description: set the sine wave frequency in Hz
    - Example: `FREQ1150` to set the frequency to 11.5 KHz
- `PHS` + channel + value
    - Description: set the phase for a channel in degrees
    - Example: `PHS2120` sets CH2 to 120 degrees
- `AMP` + channel + value
    - Description: set voltage amplitude for a channel (i.e., the "Power" setting)
    - Example: `AMP311000` sets CH3 to an amplitude of 11000
- `STE` + channel + value
    - Description: set channel to sawtooth up, down, triangle, or nop (i.e., the "S" setting) using values 0 - 3, respectively.
    - Example: `STE12` sets CH1 to sawtooth waveform 2
- `SAW` + channel + value
    - Description: sets the sawtooth or triangle period for a channel (i.e., the "SAWC" setting).  Valid values are 0 - 63
    - Example: `SAW232` sets CH2 to a value of 32
- `SRAM` + value
    - Description: sets SRAM to one of the stored waveforms of 0 - 2
    - Example: `SRAM1` sets the SRAM to waveform 1
- `STA` + channel + value
    - Description: sets a channel's SRAM starting address (i.e., the "SA" setting)
    - Example: `STA40000` sets channel CH4 to 0x0000 starting address
- `STP` + channel + value
    - Description: sets a channel's SRAM stopping address (i.e., the "SP" setting)
    - Example: `STP4FFFF` sets channel CH4 to 0xFFFF stopping address
- `YCYM` + value
    - Description: sets the pattern period (i.e. the "Mod CYC" setting).  Documentation spells this as YCYM, not the expected CYCM.
    - Example: `YCYMF000` sets the pattern period to 0xF000
- `STD` + channel + value
    - Description: sets a channel's start delay
    - Example: `STD20001` sets CH2 to have a start delay of 1
- `YCC` + channel + value
    - Description: sets how many sine wave cycles occur during a Mod CYC (i.e., the "CYC" setting).  Documentation spells this as YCC, not the expected CYC.
    - Example: `YCC30010` sets CH3 to have 10 sine wave cycles
- `OVER`
    - Description: causes the device to respond with an `OVER` (no CR or LF follows the response).  By itself, it can be used as a ping command.  After loading abitrary waveform data in to the SRAM, the `OVER` command makes the data go active on the AD9106 outputs.
    - Example: `OVER`
- `Z` + sram_block + samples
    - Description: sets arbitrary waveform data with the data into the currently active SRAM value (i.e., SRAM 0, 1, or 2).  The samples are loaded starting at register address 0x6000 + 64 \* sram_block.  Put another way, the 4096 SRAM samples are grouped into 64 blocks of 64 samples.  "sram_block" is a 2-digit decimal number that can range from 00 thru 63.  "samples" is a series of 3-digit decimal numbers in the range of 000 thru 511.  000 is the value for the most negative voltage and 511 is the value for the most positive voltage.  The maximum number of samples in a single `Z` command is 64 samples; fewer than 64 numbers is allowed.  Not including the CR and LF bytes, the maximum length of a `Z` command is 195 characters (1 + 2 + 64\*3).  To fill all of the SRAM, a series of `Z` commands are issued for all 64 blocks, possibly needing a 60+ ms pause between each command, followed by a single `OVER` command to make the data active.  Data uploaded to the device is stored in FLASH for the next time the device is booted up, though exceptions to this have been observed.
    - Example: `Z00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000511511511511511511511511511511511511511511511511000000000000000000000000511511511511511511511511000000000000511511511511000000511511000511000511` is a min-max series of square waves.  The 1st square wave is 32 samples, the 2nd is 16 samples, the 3rd is 8 samples, the 4th is 4 samples, and the 5th and 6th square waves are 2 samples each.

    - Description: sets all values to 0 and sets the devices to display CH1.  Previously uploaded SRAM data is *not* erased or returned to the factory waveforms.  This command is the only one that uses mixed-case letters.
    - Example: `Clear`
- `ALL` + multiple_commands + `END`
    - Description: purpose is unclear, but `ALL` and `END` will bracket a series when the official software's "Set All" button is clicked.  It does not set all channels to the same values nor does it delay updating the output until the `END` is send.
    - Example: see below

An example using the `ALL` and `END` commands is:

```

The response format for `XXX` is described below.  Parenthesis indicate the corresponding command that sets the value in the response, when it differs from the response.

- 4 sections corresponding to CH1 thru CH4 with the current values for each channel.  The values are: POWER (AMP), Phase (PHS), SAWC (SAW), SA (STA), SP (STP), STD, and CYC (YCC)
- A section for the global values of: FRE (FREQ), Mod_CYC (YCYM)
- A 10 digit number where:
    - Digits 1-4 are each channel's S (STE) value
    - Digits 5-8 are each channel's mode (MOD)
    - Digit 9 is the global SRAM value
    - Digit 10 is the currently displayed channel where values 0 - 3 correspond to CH1 - CH4.  In contrast, setting this value is done using CHANNEL1 - CHANNEL4, respectively.
- `OVER` is output, but it is not terminated by CR+LF
